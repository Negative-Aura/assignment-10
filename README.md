# assignment-10

This assignment is testing for bias in Google Jigsaw's Perspective API. It has a set of tweets that have been manually assigned a toxicity rating by human reviewersl. I intend to show that in ambiguous and confusing circumstances, Perspective API will aggresively deliver toxic ratings. Though further research is required, I believe this work proves that is potentially true.
